# Winter Palace - lab 3 - variant 2

## Description

Lab 3:  Basic Model of Computational

Objectives:

* Design an embedded domain-specific language or a simple text parser.
* Design architecture of a simple interpreter.
* Develop a simple interpreter for a specific model of computation.
* Develop unit tests.
* Develop input data control in the aspect-oriented style.

Variant 2:  Mathematical expression by string substitution

* Find in input string simple expressions (a, 1+2, f(1)), and replate it by its result.

* Input language is a sting like a + 2 - sin(-0.3)*(b - c).

* Should support user-specific functions by passing something like

   {"foo": lambda x: x*42 } or by named arguments.

* Run-time error should be processed correctly with detail error message.

* You should use the default Python logging module to make the

  interpreter work transparent.
